# *Die Farnkräuter der Jetztwelt*

A repository for tracings and analysis of fronds from Constantin von Ettingshausen's *Die Farnkräuter der Jetzwelt* (1865). These images were produced using a method called "nature printing", in which electroplatings of frond venation were subsequently used for printing. For the moment, this repository consists of .tif files with tracings of frond venation saved as ImageJ/FIJI overlays. The .tif file can be opened in ImageJ/FIJI and the overlays, saved as vectors, will be visible. Each file is named by Tafel (page) and Nummer (number) of the frond, as well as genus initial and species epithet.

Images are from the Biodiversity Heritage Library Flickr page: https://www.flickr.com/photos/biodivlibrary/albums/72157717106221186
